# DR002: We won't charge lower volume services to use our platform.

Date: 2021-08-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Related to [Epic 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5iSEumAuLBaKtgvyhNaGagboN7XziAnQMfuwdVpiZM/edit#) and our [second and fifth riskiest assumptions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUZeEXSU8uhPcNJxQWGZ4oxOzANx0-EolDnVqZ0qsMg/edit?pli=1#gid=0) (ID16, ID30), we wanted to know if we can make adoption of forms cost-effective during private beta and beyond. 
We tested different price points with decision-makers and different business models with our sponsors during spending review.

## Decision

We will not charge government services with fewer than 10,000 form transactions per year to use our platform. If higher volume services choose to use our platform once we open in public beta, or if a form's transactions are higher than first forecast, we could decide to charge for forms with 10,000 transactions and above.

## Consequences

Positive - most form creators will be able to use GOV.UK Forms at no cost.

This decision relates to [Plan form production](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1640103843400/cce4d74dc3ea2dd8916b8921a435b115a1c9e488?sender=u95c067cf6f303eaa90553018) part of our service.
