We use Architecture Decision Records. 

You can read about the general approach on the [GDS Way page on Architecture Decisions](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/architecture-decisions.html) and specifics about our implementation at [ADR000 - Record Architecture Decisions](https://github.com/alphagov/cifu/blob/main/ADR/ADR000-record-architecture-decisions.md). Our template ADR is [ADRXXX](https://github.com/alphagov/forms/blob/main/ADR/ADRXXX-architecture-decision-record-template.md).

In general we will follow [the GDS Way](gds-way.cloudapps.digital/), so these records will cover decisions that:
- are not already covered in the GDS Way
- are covered in the GDS Way, but have specific implementation details which need to be captured
- diverge from the guidance in the GDS Way
