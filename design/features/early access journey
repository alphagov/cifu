## What
With this journey, users can create a trial account and understand if they can upgrade to editor and how to do that. It will also automate a lot of things the adoption team would have to do otherwise, and take us a step closer to self service.

## User needs: 
As a trial user I need to know what are the criteria to become an editor
As a trial user I need to know whether someone has agreed to the MOU in my organisation 
As a GOV.UK Forms team, I need to make sure that organisations have signed an MOU before their users get permissions beyond trial.

<br>

## Why

We currently do not have a process enabling users to request editor access and start publishing forms. 

## Changes
The changes are in the product. 
Prototype can be found here: https://forms-prototypes-pr-201.herokuapp.com/product-pages/
