# EPIC 6 HOW TO HELP USERS WHEN THEY CREATE BAD FORMS 

Publishers are the most appropriate group to help assure forms. They are more engaged than Digital Assurance Managers and have the required skillset

Digital Assurance Manages are not the right audience to bring into the process for several reasons but predominately because they do not have the remit or capability set to assure forms. Their role is confined to Service Assessments only and often struggle to think outside this framework

Publishers claim they would benefit greatly from an email notification with form performance analytics, and this would prompt positive action 

However, there are question marks over who will help the very small departments who have no resources or ‘parent’ organisation to call upon. Could other department Service Teams help? 

Participants identified 4 solutions to the problem: a self assessment Q&A form which would help users identify and solve problems, a check point template for pre/ post feedback, guidance on good form design (which could be assessed), and a slimmed down, one-hour Service Assessment (for forms only)
