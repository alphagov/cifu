# Usability testing: Task list and steps to make form live

2022-08-15 / Sprint 9

## Aims
- Test usability of the task list design for understanding the process to get a form live and navigating through the tasks
- Test user story: “I need to set the email address a completed form is sent to”
- Test user story: “I need to add content about ‘what happens next’ to a confirmation page”
- Test user story: “I need to add a declaration”

## Users
- Civil Servants
- Low digital confidence
- 5 users

## Methodology
- Usability Testing

## Key Headlines

- Users found the task list clear, easy to use and logical.
- All tasks were successfully completed, although one lower digital confidence user made the email setup work unintentionally.
- Users were positive about progress labels on the task list and used them regularly.
- Several users wanted to complete the questions ‘In Progress’ label somehow.
- All completed task from task list in order. When questioned said they understood it could be completed in any order.
- Requests for an option to preview the entire form and a representation of the email set for receipt of forms on the task list page.
- Feedback that the task title ‘3. Get your form ready to go live’ is vague and could be more specific.
- Term ‘declaration’ and the link title on the task list page not clear to all users. This became clearer for some when they moved to ‘what happens next’ page.
- Examples were not always noticed/ read.
- '2000 characters’ appeared to cause some confusion.
- There are potential needs around collaboration on writing and agreeing what goes on the declaration.
- More experienced users are familiar with the process of receiving and entering a code to set up an email. One less confident user found this challenging.
- The shared inbox concept largely understood, although one user used their own email, and another thought the form completer would enter the email. Process currently explains the how, would explaining why someone else receives the code support understanding? Some users expected to double check by completing a form and checking it went through.
- Some users knew where to find this information to lunk to for accessibility and privacy statements, others didn’t. There is a general expectation that this info would be taken from the departmental website.
- Users expect guidance on how the form would be published on Whitehall.
- One user said they would agree everything in a word file before building so it can be checked.
- When low digital confidence users face high cognitive load some appear to revert thier mental models from the 'form creator' to the ‘form completer' role."
