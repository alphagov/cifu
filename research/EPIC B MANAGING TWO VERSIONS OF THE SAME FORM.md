# Epic B: Managing two versions of the same form

Managing two versions of the same form is not a widespread issue. Larger (high volume) teams are generally well-oiled machines with systems and processes in place that allow this to be managed seamlessly. 

In smaller teams, where there are less processes and resources, it can be more challenging, and the burden can fall on one person. However, in these situations many prioritise online forms and only make changes to paper forms on a case-by-case basis 

The biggest potential challenge our primary intended users would likely face would be the transition from a paper to digital mindset when it comes to creating and editing HTML forms. To help users with this we should provide GDS style guides and help sections/ videos to encourage positive form design. 

There are some positive examples where HTML forms have been readily adopted. However, in these examples HTML has overtaken paper almost entirely and they are not managed side by side.  

Version control is an issue in some departments and users may benefit from a way of managing this in a an easier way, enabling them to feel more in control and organised. Likewise, a print feature was highlighted as a useful feature and would enable the creation of two versions of the same form
