# Branching round 2 usability testing

## 2024-11-26 / Sprint 9

## Aims
- Understand what works and doesn’t work for users of the branching prototype.


### Research questions
#### High-level
- Can users understand how to implement 2 branches in a form?
- Do users understand the capability and limitations of the current design?

#### Specific
- Do users understand what Route 1 and Route 2 means?
- Do users understand how the routing is described in the ‘your questions’ page?
- Do users understand how to implement route 2 and what the page is telling them?

## Users
- GOV.UK Forms users (civil servants)
- 8 participants

## Methodology
- Usability testing and brief interviews


## Key Headlines 
Two main things are key to success:
- Ensuring users have set their questions up properly for the routing they need
- Meeting the user’s mental model and behaviours around how to apply more than one route

### Key needs when setting up the questions
- Knowing which question type is needed in order to apply routing
- Knowing what order questions need to be in to be able to add the routing correctly

### Main pain points when setting up the questions
- Adding list questions as checkboxes, not radio buttons
- Adding questions in the wrong order for applying their routing

### Mental model:
1. Build first route
2. What now?
3. Check my work
4. Build second route
5. Where do I build another route?
6. How do I build another route?

### Key mental model requirements
- Need to check their first route after adding it
- Need to be able to find how to add a second route
- Need to understand how to add a second route

### Main pain points for adding routing

#### Finding where to do it
- Not noticing ‘route 2’ before leaving the page to check if route 1 works
- Not being able to find how to add a second route
- Expecting to use ‘Add a route’ button to add a second route

#### Understanding how to do it
- Not understanding what route 2 is and what to use it for
- Not being shown error messages at the right time to prevent certain mistakes
- Ignoring error messages and continuing with incorrect journey

### Reinforced importance of checking their work, for:
- validating their work 
- understanding why things aren’t working
