# Concept testing: Add another answer 

## 2024-06-18 / Sprint 55 to 56

## Aims
- Test 2 concepts for helping people build a question that allows form fillers to add more answers.

    - Do these early concepts make sense to users?
    - Which concept seems to fit better with the users’ mental models?
    - What language do users use in relation to this type of feature/question?

## Users
- GOV.UK Forms users (civil servants)
- 5 participants

## Methodology
- Concept testing

## Key Headlines 
### Concept 1: 
- users broadly understood the new page of options.
- one wrong choice but the correct result
- overall more positive feedback for this design
- not strong evidence that the extra page was a burden - however this wasn't a normal workflow.

### Concept 2:
- there was a fair amount of confusion and error
- some wrong choices with the correct result

HOWEVER, 3 out of 5 users were primed by v2 before they saw v1, which could have influenced v1's success by priming. Still, the evidence clearly showed v2 was not easy to use anyway.

There's a strong mental model that after creating set, you will edit all the questions 'together'.

Preview was very important to participants - especially at individual question level, rather than whole form level.

‘Check your question’ and ‘edit your set’ pages were valuable validation points for people.

Some confusion, error and overlooking of links and buttons on these pages when saving and adding questions, and when wanting to navigate elsewhere.

People understood the use of minimum and maximum number of answers. They even used both min and max when they had chosen the ‘wrong’ thing (set etc), to force it to work how they needed. 

We heard more than once that it would be easier for form fillers to have the questions relating to one item (data row) on one page.

All the participants showed familiarity with the concept of this type of question, all used the phrase ‘add another’ in relation to this question model.
